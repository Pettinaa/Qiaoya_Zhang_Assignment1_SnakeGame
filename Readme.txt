  This is a JAVA Snake game I wrote, which utilizes basic game engines.
  In this  grid, the snake will eat apples to increase its own length. Every time it eats an apple, its body will increase by 1 knot. When it bites itself or collides with a wall, it will cause death in the game.
  The basic functions that have been implemented include:
	①Object Orientated Game Architecture 
	②Working Game Architecture Code
	③Working Game Code 
	④Keyboard Input Code 
	⑤Working Keyboard Input code 
	⑥Event Handling and Control of the Player Character
	⑦Working Event Handler Code
	⑧Code to shift all existing snake positions down by one array element 
	⑨Random placement of apples with respect to other game objects
	⑩Code to add a new element to the snake array / list 
	①①Working code to add new elements to the end of the snake array 
	①②Working code to shift array elements 


I added four additional features for this game.
①The first one is to add a grid on the page. Snakes, apples, and bad food will be placed on the grid， Snakes will move along the grid。
②The second one is the addition of a badfood , where once a snake eats a badfood  it will cause death and the game will end.
③The third one is the game end prompt page. Whenever the game ends, a mechanism will pop up saying "Gameover, Please Restart". When you press the spacebar, the game will restart.
④The fourth one is to set the background music, which will play at the beginning of the game and stop playing at the end of the game.

I hope you have a good gaming experience.
